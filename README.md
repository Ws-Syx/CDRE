# Embedding Compression Distortion in Video Coding for Machines

Our paper is available at [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21469). Supplementary material is at [here](CDRE_ICME2025_supplementary.pdf). 

We will finish our code as soon as possible. 

Our code will be divided into three parts, corresponding to three different downstream tasks (since the codebases for different downstream tasks are not the same). 

Each downstream task requires executing the installation process of its corresponding codebase separately.

We will complete the README file as soon as possible.
